# Building SourceGear Veracity under Mac OS

## Introduction

Assumed - you are running Mac OS Snow Leopard (10.6), have `sudo`/admin access
on your Mac, and are comfortable at a `terminal` prompt. The first two are
mandatory; the last is kinda important.

## Getting/Unpacking the Source

Retrieve the latest Veracity tarball from [sourcegear](http://www.sourcegear.com/veracity/)

Unpack it under the directory of your choice - for brevity, we'll pretend you 
unpacked it under `~/v`, and so your source tree begins at `~/v/veracity`

## Prerequisites

### XCode Toolkit

If you don't already have XCode 3.2 (or higher) installed, you can find it on 
your Snow Leopard install DVD.

If you don't have a Snow Leopard install DVD, you can download Xcode from the
Apple Developer web site.

If you decide to download Xcode, you'll need to register as an Apple Developer.
It's free. It's quick. 

Having done that, visit the 
[Download Xcode](http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html) page,
then click "Mac Dev Center" and retrieve the latest Xcode and iPhone SDK --
currently Xcode 3.2.3 and iPhone SDK 4.  That's the version used in the 
preparation of this document.

Install as instructed.

### ICU - Internal Components for Unicode

Visit the [ICU Download Page](http://site.icu-project.org/download),
and reteive the latest ICU4C tarball -- currently
[v4.4.1](http://download.icu-project.org/files/icu4c/4.4.1/icu4c-4_4_1-src.tgz).

If the version number has changed, you'll need to update the tarball name in
`thirdparty/build_mac.sh`

Copy (don't extract) this tarball to `~/v/veracity/thirdparty/archives`

### CMake

Install [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)

Download the [Darwin installer](http://cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.2-Darwin-universal.dmg), and install as instructed.

### SpiderMonkey

You'll also need to get the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine.

To do so, visit [mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/spidermonkey)
and grab the latest SpiderMonkey source - currently
[v1.8 RC 1](http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/js/js-1.8.0-rc1.tar.gz)

If the version number has changed, you'll need to update the tarball name in
`thirdparty/build_mac.sh`

Copy (don't extract) this archive to `~/v/veracity/thirdparty/archives`, then 
`cd ~/v/veracity/thirdparty` and run:

    sudo ./build_mac.sh
    
## Installing sgneeds

The `build_mac.sh` script created an `sgneeds_xxx.zip` file, where "xxx" is
based on the current date and time.  You'll need to extract this to your
root directory.

Sorry about that, we'll clean that up soon.

Anyway.

Assuming you're looking at `~/v/veracity/thirdparty/sgneeds_2010_07_01_123.zip`,
you'll want to:

    cd /
    sudo unzip ~/v/veracity/thirdparty/sgneeds_2010_07_01_123.zip
    
which will create the `/sgneeds` folder.
    
You'll want this in your library path, so edit `~/.profile` and add:

    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/sgneeds/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
    
You should open a new terminal window to ensure this is in effect before
building/running Veracity.

## Creating the Build Directory

`cmake` will handle the creation of Makefiles, etc. You just need to give it a
place to work.

For example, let's create a `~/v/debug`, a neighbor of our source directory.

cd to this folder, then run:

    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../veracity
    
You now have a build tree, replete with Makefiles.  You'll only need to run the
top-level one. So:

    cd ~/v/debug
    make
    
upon successful completion, you should run:

    make test
    
All tests should pass, with any exceptions noted on our
[known issues](http://www.sourcegear.com/veracity/help/known_issues.html) page.

To make your life easier at this point, you'll want to add the following to
your path:

    ~/v/debug/src/cmd
    ~/v/debug/src/script
    
the homes of `vv` (the Veracity command-line app) and `vscript` (the scripting
engine), respectively.
